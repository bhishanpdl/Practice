# How do you communicate complex statistical concepts (like the results of an A/B test) to non-technical business stakeholders?

Of course. Here is a tailored answer that uses Labcorp-specific terminology and scenarios, framing your communication skills within the context of RWE and clinical trials.

### **Sample Answer (Tailored for Labcorp)**

"Communicating complex statistical concepts to non-technical stakeholders is at the heart of generating actionable Real-World Evidence. My approach is to translate statistical findings into clear, compelling business and clinical narratives without oversimplifying the science.

**For instance, let's say my team has just completed an analysis comparing real-world progression-free survival between a new oncology drug and the standard of care.** The statistical output might be a hazard ratio with a confidence interval and a p-value. My process for presenting this to a team from, say, Market Access or Medical Affairs would be:

1.  **Lead with the Clinical or Business Conclusion:** I would never start with the p-value. I'd begin with the headline: *'Our analysis provides strong evidence that patients on the new drug experience a significantly longer period without their cancer progressing compared to the current standard treatment.'* This immediately answers their most important question: *So what?*

2.  **Translate Statistics into Meaningful Metrics:** I would then immediately translate the statistical result into an intuitive, patient-centric metric. I'd say: *'Statistically, we see a 40% reduction in the risk of progression or death. For a typical patient, this could mean an additional 6 months of progression-free survival. This is a level of efficacy we can be very confident in, with less than a 1-in-1000 chance that this result is due to random noise in the data.'* This replaces 'Hazard Ratio = 0.60, p < 0.001' with a story about patient benefit and statistical confidence.

3.  **Frame Findings in Terms of Stakeholder Goals:** I tailor the message to the audience's priorities.
    *   For a **Market Access** team preparing for payer negotiations, I'd connect the result to value: *'This significant improvement in a key efficacy endpoint directly supports the value proposition for premium pricing and helps overcome formulary barriers.'*
    *   For a **Medical Affairs** team, I'd focus on the clinical narrative: *'This RWE strengthens the body of evidence from clinical trials and can help inform treatment guidelines by showing the drug's effectiveness in a broader, real-world population.'*
    *   I use clear visuals from tools like **Power BI** to show Kaplan-Meier curvesâ€”not just as statistical plots, but as simple stories of separation between treatment groups over time.

**The ultimate goal** is to move the conversation from *'Is the effect statistically significant?'* to *'What does this mean for our strategy?'* This approach ensures that the robust statistical work we do doesn't just live in a report but directly informs critical decisions on drug development, commercialization, and ultimately, patient care.

**At Labcorp, where the bridge between data and decision is so vital,** I would be diligent in being that translator, ensuring that the insights from our RWE and clinical analyses are deployed effectively and ethically."
