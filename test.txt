As a Researcher at Ohio University, I applied advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex scientific challenges. My work encompassed fraud detection, sentiment analysis, clustering biomedical data, and astronomical image classification. I developed and optimized predictive models, tackled class imbalance with oversampling techniques, and leveraged statistical methodologies to enhance model precision. Additionally, I deployed end-to-end machine learning solutions using cloud technologies and containerization, ensuring scalability and efficiency. My experience in data science software development involved automation, CI/CD integration, and thorough documentation, reflecting a strong foundation in analytical problem-solving and practical application of AI-driven methodologies.
