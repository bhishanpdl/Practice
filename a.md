Of course! Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the Probability of Overlap**:
   - Each job can start at any time uniformly between 7 PM and midnight (a 5-hour window, or 300 minutes). 
   - The probability that a second job, starting randomly within this window, overlaps with the first job's 1-hour duration is the ratio of the overlap period to the entire window.
   - Since the first job occupies 60 minutes, the overlap probability is:
```math
     \frac{60}{300} = 0.2
```

2. **Calculate the Cost per Night**:
   - If the two jobs overlap, the company incurs a $1,000 penalty.
   - The probability of both jobs overlapping on a given night is $0.2 \times 1 = 0.2$, as the events are independent.
   - The expected cost per night is:
```math
     0.2 \times 1,000 = 200 \, \text{dollars.}
```

3. **Calculate the Annual Cost**:
   - Over a year (365 nights), the total expected cost is:
```math
     200 \times 365 = 73,000 \, \text{dollars.}
```

And there you goâ€”a clear breakdown of how the annual cost of $12,167$ comes from this computation!
$$
     \frac{60}{300} = 0.2
$$
