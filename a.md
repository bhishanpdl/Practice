Certainly! Logistic regression is used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. Here's the formula:

### Logistic Regression Equation:

The logistic regression model estimates the probability \( p \) that a given input \( X \) belongs to a particular class (usually labeled as 1). The formula for the logistic regression model is:

$$
p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

Where \( z \) is the linear combination of the input variables:

$$
z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n
$$

Here:
- \( p \) is the probability of the dependent variable (e.g., the probability of success).
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept term (constant).
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients corresponding to each predictor \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \).
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

### Sigmoid Function:

The logistic function (or sigmoid function) transforms the linear combination \( z \) into a probability value between 0 and 1. The function is defined as:

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

### Putting It All Together:

The complete logistic regression equation can be written as:

$$
p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n)}}
$$

### Example:

Suppose we have a logistic regression model with two predictors \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \):

$$
z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2
$$

If the coefficients are:
- \( \beta_0 = -1 \)
- \( \beta_1 = 2 \)
- \( \beta_2 = 0.5 \)

And the input values are \( X_1 = 3 \) and \( X_2 = 2 \), then:

$$
z = -1 + 2 \cdot 3 + 0.5 \cdot 2 = -1 + 6 + 1 = 6
$$

The probability \( p \) is:

$$
p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-6}} \approx 0.9975
$$

This means that, based on this model, the probability of the outcome being the positive class (e.g., success) is approximately 99.75%.

I hope this clarifies logistic regression for you! If you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask.
