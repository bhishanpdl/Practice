Sure thing! Here’s the formula for calculating Cohen's d:

$$ d = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SD_{pooled}} $$

Where:
- $ M_1 $ = Mean of group 1
- $ M_2 $ = Mean of group 2
- $ SD_{pooled} $ = Pooled standard deviation of both groups

The pooled standard deviation ($ SD_{pooled} $) is calculated as:

$$ SD_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)SD_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)SD_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}} $$

Where:
- $ n_1 $ = Number of subjects in group 1
- $ n_2 $ = Number of subjects in group 2
- $ SD_1 $ = Standard deviation of group 1
- $ SD_2 $ = Standard deviation of group 2

By plugging in the means and standard deviations of your two groups into this formula, you can calculate Cohen’s d to understand the effect size between them.

Hope this helps! Need an example to see it in action?
